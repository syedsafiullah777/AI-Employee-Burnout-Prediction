# Employee Burnout Analysis

This project is focused on predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze and predict burnout levels in employees based on various demographic and work-related features. By doing so, organizations can proactively identify at-risk employees and take preventative measures to improve overall wellbeing and productivity in the workplace.

## Project Overview

Employee burnout is a growing concern in modern workplaces, and predicting it early can help organizations implement strategies to reduce its negative impact. This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of burnout based on employee data. The analysis can help organizations identify employees who may be at risk of burnout and take preventive actions to improve employee wellbeing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Openpyxl** (for Excel file handling)

## Features

- **Data analysis and preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Machine learning**: Use of regression models and KNN to predict employee burnout.
- **Model evaluation**: Using various metrics like R² score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of data and model performance.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains employee demographic information and their work environment details. It is used to predict burnout levels in employees. The data includes variables such as gender, company type, work-from-home setup, and various other factors that could influence burnout.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-Burnout-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Employee-Burnout-Analysis
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

Once the environment is set up, you can use Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `Employee_Burnout_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Models Used

This project uses the following models to predict employee burnout:

- **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model to predict burnout levels.
- **Ridge Regression**: A variation of linear regression that includes L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric model that predicts burnout based on the closest neighbors in the feature space.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
